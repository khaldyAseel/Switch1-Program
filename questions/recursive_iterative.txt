### **Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursive vs Iterative Solutions**

#### **Advantages of Recursive Solutions**
1. **Simpler and Cleaner Code:**
   - Recursive solutions can often result in more compact and readable code, especially for problems with natural recursive structures (e.g., tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms).

2. **Natural Fit for Divide-and-Conquer:**
   - Recursive solutions are a natural fit for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems, like merge sort or quicksort.

#### **Disadvantages of Recursive Solutions**
1. **Higher Memory Usage:**
   - Each recursive call adds a frame to the call stack, leading to higher memory usage, especially for deep recursions.

2. **Risk of Stack Overflow:**
   - If the recursion depth exceeds the system's maximum stack size, a stack overflow error occurs. This is a significant concern for problems with large input sizes.


#### **Advantages of Iterative Solutions**
1. **Efficient Memory Usage:**
   - Iterative solutions do not rely on the call stack, leading to better memory efficiency, especially for large inputs.

2. **Avoids Stack Overflow:**
   - Since iterative solutions do not use recursive calls, they are not limited by the system's stack size and can handle large input sizes without error.


#### **Disadvantages of Iterative Solutions**
1. **More Complex Code:**
   - Iterative solutions often require more boilerplate code, such as manually managing stacks or loops, which can make them harder to read and maintain.

2. **Less Intuitive for Some Problems:**
   - Problems that naturally lend themselves to recursion (e.g., tree traversal) can become more complex and less intuitive when implemented iteratively.


### **Example Use Cases**
- **Recursive Solution**: Tree traversal (e.g., DFS), factorial computation, Fibonacci sequence (with memoization).
- **Iterative Solution**: Reversing a linked list, traversing a graph with an explicit stack, dynamic programming.
